# media_hoster

a small project I made in 2022 for my friends.

it automatically encoded images and files to be below 8 megabytes, for discord embeds.

now that invisible links have been patched, I don't see a good reason to be using custom hosters at all, past funny domains. therefore, I will release this project now as it is of no use to me.

the interesting encoding logic is in [util.rs](src/util.rs).
